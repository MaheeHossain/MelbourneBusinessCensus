# MelbourneBusinessCensus
University Assignment for COMP20003

This was a project done in 2020 which used the C language, and taught the skills of memory management, algorithms and linked list structures. 
It gives us a data file of the the business details of Melbourne businesses, and makes us turn it into a searchable dictionary, where you can
search for businesses and for values using keywords.
